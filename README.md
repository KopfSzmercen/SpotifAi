# Short description
In short, the core of the project is an AI agent who can reason, pick tools and use its knowledge to respond to user query.
The agent can read Spotify documentation, plan the sqeuence of endpoints to use, generate parameters and correct itself when an error occurs.
The result is a program which can use Spotify Api endpoints without hard-coding any logic other than authorization.
